## The teachingRSE project: "Teaching and Learning Research Software Engineering" [![CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY%204.0-lightgrey.svg)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

It started all at a workshop at deRSE23 in Paderborn where the community came together to discuss what to teach to future RSEs
and in which institutions to bring up the next generation of RSEs.

As we discovered, the scope of this task is so big that 
we had to split the paper in different subpapers highlighting different aspects

Get the latest version of the respective PDF files here:

* "Foundational competencies and responsibilities of an RSE" ([competencies.pdf](https://github.com/CaptainSifff/paper_teaching-learning-RSE/blob/build/competencies.pdf))

## How to build from this repo:
- make sure you have the necessary system dependencies: apt-get install   xz-utils make sed gpg-agent pandoc latexmk biber texlive-bibtex-extra
- let's get the required pandoc modules via pip: python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt 
- execute make from the top-level-folder

## Publication
We currently have split the topic of teaching RSEs in Germany across four papers.
We aim for a publication of most of these papers.
All people that have participated in discussions with us,
e.g. at deRSE23 or undeRSE23 are at least eligible for contributor status.
If you have participated regularly at our weekly working meetings you are eligible for
authorship.

The first paper,
_Foundational Competencies and Responsibilities of a Research Software Engineer_,
is now available as a pre-print: https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11457
Feedback is welcome as an issue on this repository.
